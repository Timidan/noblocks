Zap by Paycrest is a dApp developed for the [Onchain Summer Buildathon](https://onchain-summer.devfolio.co/). Our goal is to simplify the conversion of cryptocurrency to local currency by leveraging a decentralized liquidity protocol, we aim to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

Check out our live demo at [zap.paycrest.io](https://zap.paycrest.io).

## üöÄ Running Locally

To run Zap Waitlist locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paycrest/zap.git
cd zap
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the waitlist page.

## üìö How It Works

Zap streamlines the conversion process through a simple flow:

1. **Create Order:** User creates an order on the [Gateway Smart Contract](https://github.com/paycrest/contracts) (escrow) through the Zap interface.
2. **Aggregate:** Paycrest Protocol Aggregator indexes the order and assigns it to one or more [Provision Nodes](https://github.com/paycrest/provider) run by liquidity providers.
3. **Fulfill:** The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to the recipient's local bank account or mobile money wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSP).
